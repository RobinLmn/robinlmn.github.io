Hi! Welcome to my website! <br><br>
As a current student at McGill University in Physics and Computer Science, I am passionate about information technology and problem-solving. 
I love puzzles and challenges, so if you have an unsolvable enigma for me, I am your guy! 
<br><br>
Before I go on, and because I am sure that is what you are interested in, here is my <a href="https://robinlmn.github.io/pdf/robin-leman-resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> 
and <a href="https://robinlmn.github.io/pdf/robin-leman-transcript.pdf" target="_blank">School Transcript</a>.
<br><br>
I am curious and eager to learn: always looking for new experiences and new skills to acquire. If you are looking for me, you will probably find me on youtube 
watching new tutorials or reading science blogs and Wikipedia pages. 
<br><br>
I love  <a href="https://github.com/filrod/UbisoftGameLabMcGill_2" target="_blank">game development</a> to the point where I prefer making games than playing them. 
I'm passionate about <a href="https://github.com/RobinLmn/md5-decryption-crackingchallenge" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a>: it probably comes from my brother, 
who used to design me hacking challenges and bought me a textbook on ethical hacking when I was ten.
<br><br>
More than ever, I think <a href="https://github.com/RobinLmn/McHacks7_re-ycle" target="_blank">sustainability and environment preservation</a> are crucial to our world. 
I like having an impact on my work and will always look into having
a positive influence on the planet.
<br><br>
I would love to connect with you, either on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-leman-a5043816b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or 
by <a href="mailto:robin.leman@mail.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">Mail</a>, so don't hesitate to reach out!

      Hi! Welcome to my website! <br><br>
      As a current student at McGill University in Physics and Computer Science, I am passionate about information technology and problem-solving. 
      My current interests are centered around game development, especially real time computer animation and physics simulation.
      <br><br>
      Before I go on, and because I am sure that is what you are interested in, here is my <a href="https://robinlmn.github.io/pdf/robin-leman-resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>.
      <br><br>
      I am curious and eager to learn: always looking for new experiences and new skills to acquire. If you are looking for me, you will probably find me on youtube 
      watching new tutorials or reading science blogs and Wikipedia pages. 
      <br><br>
      I love  <a href="https://github.com/filrod/UbisoftGameLabMcGill_2" target="_blank">game development</a> to the point where I prefer making games than playing them. I have more and
      more specialized in computer animation and physics simulation. That is why I created
      <a href="https://robinlmn.github.io/achilles.html" target="_blank">Achilles</a>, a 3D Physics Engine in ECS, with translational and rotational dynamics, collision detection and 
      response, and a simple spring system for softbody simulation.
      <br><br>
      More than ever, I think <a href="https://github.com/RobinLmn/McHacks7_re-ycle" target="_blank">sustainability and environment preservation</a> are crucial to our world. 
      I like my work to make an impact and will always look into having a positive influence on the planet.
      <br><br>
      I would love to connect with you, either on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-leman-a5043816b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or 
      by <a href="mailto:robin.leman@mail.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">e-mail</a>, so don't hesitate to reach out!

      Welcome to my website!
      <br><br>
      I am a Software Engineer specializing in the design and architecture of data-driven systems. I am currently working at Electronic Arts, 
      but I have passed experiences at Relic Entertainment (SEGA), The Coalition (Microsoft Xbox), and Ubisoft. 
      You can learn more about my experiences in my <a href="https://robinleman.com/robin-leman-resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>.
      <br><br>
      While game development is my primary focus, I am always open to new opportunities in tech, AI, robotics, simulation and much more.  If you are looking for a passionate 
      and dedicated engineer with a strong foundation in C++, I would love to connect! Feel free to reach out through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-leman/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
       or by <a href="mailto:jobs@robinleman.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>.
      <br><br>
      The 'Projects' section contains some of the work I did while studying at McGill University. If you want to see what my early days as a game programmer were like, feel free to take a look!

      Thank you for visiting!
